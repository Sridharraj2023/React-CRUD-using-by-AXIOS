# React CRUD by AXIOS

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with React and Axios. It demonstrates how to manage a list of items with basic CRUD operations.

## API Endpoints

For demonstration purposes, you can use JSON Server to mock the API. The endpoints are as follows:

- `GET /items` - Fetch all items
- `POST /items` - Create a new item
- `PUT /items/:id` - Update an existing item
- `DELETE /items/:id` - Delete an item
